Some key statistics from the evaluation summary:
1.	R-squared is 0.794, meaning that 79.4% of the variance in ‘Sales’ is explained by independent variables. This is a decent R-squared value.
2.	Higher adjusted R-squared indicates that the additional input variables are adding value to the model
3.	Prob (F-statistics) has a very low p-value (practically low). Meaning that the model fit is statistically significant, and the explained variance isn’t purely by chance.
4.	Skew - measure of data symmetry. We want to see something close to zero, indicating the residual distribution is normal. As this dataset is mid-size, therefore it has decent skew.
